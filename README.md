This is a quick little helper utility for playing the excellent word game [Person Do Thing](https://persondothing.com/), which is like extreme Taboo in which there are only 40 valid words your clues can use.

If you're playing the game in a text-based format, you can use this checker to compose or paste in your clues to make sure they don't contain any invalid words.
